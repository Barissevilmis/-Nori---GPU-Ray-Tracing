**Final Project Proposal**

Student name: Baris Sevilmis

Sciper number: 306798


Scene description and motivation
================================

Describe the scene you plan to render. Use at least one motivational image.

<h><b>SCENE: 'INTERSTELLAR BLACKHOLE' <!-- and Waves --> </b></h>
<p>
    Scene to be rendered, considering the theme of the year 'loop',  will be to render Interstellar type blackhole image.
    One of the main reasons is that the visual appearence of such a scene is personally the most visually appealing challenge and magnificent as well.
    Nonetheless singularity could be a really decent visual descriptor and representation of the annual theme in addition.

Feature list
============

Using the table below, list the features you'll use to achieve your render, and how they are used.

  * Include the point counts, they should add up to *80 points*.
  * If your list of features adds up to more than 80 points, you must reduce the point count for the features of your choice until the total reaches 80 points exactly.


<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Feature</th>
        <th>Standard point count</th>
        <th>Adjusted point count</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>GPU Ray Tracer</td>
        <td>80</td>
        <td>80</td>
        <h><b>FEATURE 1: GPU RAY TRACER</b></h>
        <p>
        Project will be mainly based on creating a GPU based rendering algorithm by utilizing CUDA.
        Nori architecture will be improved accordingly to be able to run GPU based code as well as CPU versions.
        For convenience, already existing data types will be used as much as possible, and all the newly added functionality 
        will be explained in detail.   
        </p>
        <p> 
        OptiX 7 will be used in addition to classic computational CUDA functions, with which speedup is expected to improve.
        Moreover with the RTX graphics card requirement, NVIDIA OptiX Ray Tracing Engine is expected to perform even better compared to naive CUDA based methods whereas 
        the complexity of implementation does show impovements as well.
        </p>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>'Crazy Physics'</td>
        <td>60</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <h><b>FEATURE 2: CRAZY PHYSICS - INTERSTELLAR BLACKHOLE</b></h>
        <p>
        Although, main purpose of the project is to implement GPU based ray tracing algorithms and improve the performance of already existing optimized CPU algorithms.
        Therefore, validating performance speedup will require new costly rendering operations. Various different rendering results will be included in the final performance of algorithm,
        whereas the second aim of the project will be to render a blackhole image as well as to represent annual theme of the project which is loop. Additional loop themed rendering methods 
        are to be included as well. In any case, 'Interstellar' type blackhole is to be expected as the main loop theme object.
